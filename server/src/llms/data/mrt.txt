Gas-less transactions have been implemented for purchasing apartments, upgrades, and smart items both on the website and within Decentraland. We have our own meta-transaction server. Payment can be made in two currencies: USDT and MANA at the current rate.
Social features like dashboard of public flats, with visitors counter and real-time online user counter. Anyone can express them apartment by showing a sign over the door, make a short description, show avatar and owner of the flat.
We see the future of the project as a simple, no-code solution for Decentraland citizens.
Many use cases for their space are already available: NFT gallery, fashion shows, parties with streaming in the apartment, parkour, paid events, business cards, shops, meeting places with friends, and a piece of home and personal corner in the metaverse.
